/**
 * Instance of the GatewayConnection identifies a single user connection
 * to the external network. The gateway connection is responsinble for
 * maintaining the connection and translating all the data between
 * Jabber/XMPP protocol and the protocol of the external network.
 * <p/>
 * It is recommended that the library for connecting to the exernal
 * network uses internal thread pooling and all it's method work in
 * non-blocking mode. Otherwise delays on one connection may affect
 * all other connections.
 * <p/>
 * Please consider also using NIO for better networking performnce.
 * Recommended library for NIO is the one available in Tigase server
 * core package.
